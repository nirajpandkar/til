# LCM

* Conventional method

> lcm(a, b) =  (a * b) / gcd(a, b)

* Pro Tip

M is divisible by all numbers from 1 to N iff M is equal to the product of all prime powers p^k where p is prime and divides M, and p < N, and k is the largest integer such that p^k < N.

For example, 2520 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 * 7.
